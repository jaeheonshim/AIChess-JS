# AIChess-JS
A chess engine achieved by using the minimax algorithm and alpha beta node pruning for efficiency.
This is a big work in progress, only the basic scaffolding for this project exists.
Built using chess.js and chessboard.js

The depth of the tree search can be changed by changing the value passed into the non recursive first all of the minimax function. Currently it is set to 2, but you can change it to whatever you want.
However... If you set it too high your computer may be unable to process the moves and be frozen. I would recommend that you stay under 5 unless you know what you're doing.
